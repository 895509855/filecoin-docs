# Filcoin primer

The following “syllabus” of instructional videos and materials covers all aspects of the Filecoin network – from mining to storage to application development. This resource is designed for anyone interested in learning about the history and development of the network, as well as how to leverage the network at all levels: mining, building, and storing.

## Filecoin Fundamentals
