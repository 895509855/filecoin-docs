# Tools

There are lots of tools developers can use to create Filecoin applications. While not every tool useful to Filecoin developers is listed here, these are the ones we think will help speed up the application development for new developers.

## API clients

API clients take care of the low-level details of making requests and handling responses and let you focus on writing code specific to your project. They can also translate between different programming languages. [Find out more →](./api-clients.md)

## Filecoin-backed pinning

Filecoin-backed pinning services are data storage and retrieval services that offer the performance and availability of IPFS alongside the data persistence features of Filecoin’s decentralized storage network. [Find out more →](./filecoin-backed-pinning-services.md)

## Powergate

Powergate exposes higher-level APIs for developers that facilitate easier interaction with IPFS and Filecoin nodes. Powergate also handles wallet management, long-term deal management, and provides many features that improve the overall experience of being a storage client on Filecoin.

## Signing libraries

Signing libraries can be used to sign transactions without requiring a dedicated node. This allows you to create signed transactions in an application that is running offline, on a mobile device, or anywhere. [Find out more →](./signing-libraries.md)

## Slate

Slate is an open-source Filecoin client for data that makes it easy to collect, organize, and share data anywhere. [Find out more →](./slate.md)

## Wallets

To simplify or automate how users make payments, you can integrate wallets directly into your application or service. [Find out more →](./wallets.md)
