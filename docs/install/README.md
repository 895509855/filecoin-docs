# Install Filecoin


## Miners

Miners host the infrastructure that holds the Filecoin network together! Without miners, there would only be a handful of very centralized, bootstrap servers being hosted by Protocol Labs. The first step to building a miner is [setting up a Lotus node ->](./lotus/README.md)

## Developers

The entire Filecoin ecosystem is open to developers to build interesting and revolutionary applications with! However, depending on your use-case and experience, you may not need to host your own Filecoin node. If you've never built anything with Filecoin before, we recommend checking out the [Getting started](../build/README.md) section to learn the ropes. In that guide, you'll use Powergate, a service that hosts Filecoin nodes for you, so you don't have to worry about spinning one up. Smaller-scale projects like weekend jams or hackathons may also benefit from using Powergate since there's very little set up time. If, however, you've done all this before and are building a fairly complex project, then you'll absolutely benefit from [setting up a Filecoin node ->](./lotus/README.md)

## For everyone else

Are you here just to play around with this whole _Filecoin, IPFS, decentralized web_ thing? Then you absolutely don't need to install a Filecoin node. [You can if you want to, by all means](./lotus/README.md)! But you might be better off having a look at Slate: it's a website that lets you interact with the Filecoin network _without_ having to install anything.
